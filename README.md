The Spotify Data Analysis Project: In today's changing world, data analysis has become crucial in fields such as business, research, and meteorology. This project showcases the role that data plays in making decisions, advancing research initiatives, and even predicting weather patterns.

The immense potential of data analysis is evident in this project, which focuses on extracting insights from music-related datasets using SQL queries and aggregate functions (Sum, Order by, Group by, Rank, Limit,  etc.). At its core, Spotify takes center stage as an audio streaming giant with captivating features like seamless song sharing and synchronized lyrics display.

Throughout this project, I delved into the realm of data using SQL’s built-in functions and JOIN operations. From analyzing to visualizing the data , this project covers all aspects of data processing. The interactive environment provided by SQL editor as MySQL Workbench enhanced my experience by allowing me to engage with the data and discover patterns.

Through the Spotify Data Analysis Project, I not only sharpened my SQL querying skills but also gained a deep understanding of how data intertwines with the world of music. This journey provided insights and equipped me with confidence to undertake similar projects in the future.

## 💾 Data Setup in SQL Workbench

In this project, I worked with a music database using MySQL Workbench. The database includes several interrelated tables that reflect real-world entities in a music store environment.

- album: Contains details about each album, including Album ID and Title.

- artist: Holds information about artists, including their unique Artist ID and Name.

- customer: Stores customer data such as names, addresses, and contact details.

- employee: Represents employees of the store with their roles and reporting structure.

- genre: Lists various music genres with their Genre IDs.

- invoice: Captures billing information including Invoice ID, Customer ID, Date, and Total.

- invoice_line: Stores line-by-line details of each invoice, such as Track ID, Quantity, and Unit Price.

- media_type: Contains types of media formats like MPEG audio, AAC audio, etc.

- playlist: Stores playlist names and their IDs.

- playlist_track: Maps tracks to their respective playlists.

- track: Contains metadata for each song, including Name, Album ID, Media Type, Genre, Composer, Duration, and Price.

These tables were queried using SQL to perform various data analysis operations such as aggregation, joins, filtering, sorting, and ranking to extract business insights from the music data.
