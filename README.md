## üíæ Data Setup in SQL Workbench

In this project, I worked with a music database using MySQL Workbench. The database includes several interrelated tables that reflect real-world entities in a music store environment.

- album: Contains details about each album, including Album ID and Title.

- artist: Holds information about artists, including their unique Artist ID and Name.

- customer: Stores customer data such as names, addresses, and contact details.

- employee: Represents employees of the store with their roles and reporting structure.

- genre: Lists various music genres with their Genre IDs.

- invoice: Captures billing information including Invoice ID, Customer ID, Date, and Total.

- invoice_line: Stores line-by-line details of each invoice, such as Track ID, Quantity, and Unit Price.

- media_type: Contains types of media formats like MPEG audio, AAC audio, etc.

- playlist: Stores playlist names and their IDs.

- playlist_track: Maps tracks to their respective playlists.

- track: Contains metadata for each song, including Name, Album ID, Media Type, Genre, Composer, Duration, and Price.

These tables were queried using SQL to perform various data analysis operations such as aggregation, joins, filtering, sorting, and ranking to extract business insights from the music data.

## üîç Exploring the Dataset

After setting up the database in MySQL Workbench, the initial step was to explore and understand the structure of each table. Using SQL queries like SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;, I previewed the contents of key tables to get a sense of the data available for analysis.

This exploratory phase involved:

- Reviewing column names, data types, and sample values

- Identifying primary and foreign key relationships between tables

- Understanding the volume and variety of data in each table

- Checking for any missing or duplicate values

- Mapping out how tables such as track, artist, genre, invoice, and customer are interconnected for future joins

This step helped me plan relevant queries and design a structured approach to uncover meaningful insights from the dataset.

limit 1;
```
![Promotional Festival Location](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52158c5f-fd96-4710-bbc8-3dff33213cdf)

Query Explanation:

This SQL query analyzes invoice data to identify which city generated the highest total revenue. It works in three key steps: First, it groups all invoices by their billing_city using the GROUP BY clause. Then it calculates the sum of the total column for each city, labeling this aggregated value as "Totals". The ORDER BY sum(total) DESC sorts these city totals in descending order, putting the highest-revenue city at the top. Finally, the LIMIT 1 restriction returns only this top-performing city. The result shows Prague as the highest-grossing location with total revenues of approximately 273.24 currency units, making it the most successful city for this promotional festival based on invoice totals. This type of analysis helps businesses understand their best-performing markets for strategic decision-making.

# Viewing the Data
select c.first_name,c.last_name,sum(total) as Total from customer as c
inner join invoice as i on c.customer_id = i.customer_id
group by c.first_name,c.last_name
order by Total desc
limit 1;
```

![Best Customer Recognition](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b36a213-b4ad-4434-8962-e2c527205bf6)

Query Explanation:

This SQL query identifies the top-spending customer by analyzing purchase history across joined customer and invoice data. First, it connects the customer and invoice tables through an inner join using matching customer_id values. The query then groups the combined records by each customer's first and last name while calculating their cumulative spending using sum(total) as Total. By sorting these aggregated totals in descending order with ORDER BY Total DESC and limiting to just one result with LIMIT 1, the query efficiently pinpoints the highest-value customer. The output reveals Franti≈°ek Wichteloviƒç as the best customer with total purchases worth approximately 144.54 currency units, making them the clear candidate for special recognition or loyalty rewards. This analysis provides valuable insight for customer relationship management and targeted marketing strategies.

JOIN artist ar ON ar.artist_id = al.artist_id
JOIN genre g ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
where g.name ="Rock"
GROUP BY ar.artist_id, ar.name
ORDER BY number_of_songs DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

![Top 10 Rock Music Artists](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b115211-31c4-473d-8cc3-16aae87a5ba9)

Query Explanation:

This SQL query identifies the top 10 rock artists based on their number of available tracks in the database. The analysis begins by connecting five key tables: track, album, artist, and genre through a series of JOIN operations that link tracks to their respective albums and artists while filtering for only rock genre tracks (WHERE g.name = "Rock"). By grouping the results by artist ID and name (GROUP BY ar.artist_id, ar.name), then counting the tracks per artist (COUNT(t.track_id) AS number_of_songs), the query quantifies each rock artist's representation in the catalog. The results are then sorted in descending order by track count (ORDER BY number_of_songs DESC) and limited to the top 10 performers (LIMIT 10). The output reveals AC/DC as the dominant rock artist with 18 tracks, followed by Aerosmith (15 tracks), and Audioslave and Led Zeppelin tied with 14 tracks each - providing valuable insights into the most prolific rock artists in this music collection, which could inform inventory decisions, promotional campaigns, or customer recommendations.


-  ### **`Genre Popularity by Country`** 

Mapped the most popular music genre per country to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

```sql
# Viewing the Data

GROUP BY c.country, g.name, g.genre_id
    ORDER BY c.country ASC, purchases DESC
)
SELECT * 
FROM popular_genre 
WHERE RowNo <= 1;

```

![Genre Popularity by Country](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d081a8-fbe7-409c-a1f0-1b2cd75c93f6)

Query Explanation:

This SQL query analyzes music genre popularity across different countries to reveal global listening trends. By connecting purchase records with customer locations and track genres, it identifies each country's most-bought music style. The results show rock music dominates overwhelmingly, being the top genre in 21 of the 24 countries analyzed - including major markets like the USA (70 purchases), Canada (57), United Kingdom (47), and Brazil (26). Only Norway and Spain break this pattern, preferring metal instead. The analysis uses a sophisticated ranking system that first counts all genre purchases per country, then uses ROW_NUMBER() to identify each nation's clear favorite. This reveals rock's universal appeal while highlighting rare regional variations, providing valuable insights for music platforms to customize their offerings - like emphasizing rock playlists globally while potentially adding more metal content for Scandinavian and Spanish audiences.

SELECT * FROM Customer_with_country 
WHERE RowNo <= 1
ORDER BY total_spending DESC;
```

![Top Customers by Country](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f64eea01-df60-43e9-9d53-0e5ee1729f83)

Query Explanation:

This SQL query identifies the highest-spending customer in each country by analyzing purchase data. First, it connects customer information with their invoice records to calculate each customer's total spending. The query then organizes customers by country and ranks them based on purchase amounts, assigning the top spender in each country a rank of 1. After establishing these rankings, the query filters to show only the top-ranked customer from each nation. Finally, it presents these leading customers sorted by total spending in descending order.

The results reveal the Czech Republic's customer as the leading global spender with 144.54 inpurchases,followed by Ireland‚Ä≤stop customer at 144.54 inpurchases. The dataset covers 24 countries, with spending values ranging from 144.54 down to  37.62 in Denmark. This analysis provides valuable insights into international purchasing behaviors and regional market strengths.
